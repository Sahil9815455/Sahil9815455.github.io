            <body>
            <p>Protected areas are the cornerstone of biodiversity conservation; they maintain key habitats, provide refugia, allow for species migration and movement, 
               and ensure the maintenance of natural processes across the landscape. Not only do protected areas secure biodiversity conservation, they also secure the
               well-being of humanity itself. Protected areas provide livelihoods for nearly 1.1 billion people, are the primary source of drinking water for over a 
               third of the world’s largest cities and are a major factor in ensuring global food security.Well managed protected areas harbouring participatory and 
               equitable governance mechanisms yield significant benefits far beyond their boundaries,which can be translated into cumulative advantages across a national 
               economy and contribute to poverty reduction and sustainable development including achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. As the detrimental impact
               of climate change threatens the planet, protected areas provide a convenient solution to an inconvenient truth. Better managed, better connected, better governed
               and better financed protected areas are recognized as the key to both mitigation and adaptation responses to climate change.</p>
               <h3>Parks and Protected areas : </h3>
               <p>Canada has committed to protecting 25% of its land and freshwater by 2025, on the way to 30% by 2030. 
                It is essential to meet these targets to ultimately protect at least half of Canada, which is necessary 
                to conserve the country’s natural landscapes and unique wildlife. Check out the Resources section for our
                 latest reports and other publications, including our Report Card and our Roadmap to 2030. Join the movement 
                 to protect 30% of Canada’s land and ocean by 2030.

                 <h3>Benefits of Protected Areas : </h3>
                 <ul style="list-style-image:url('bullet.gif');">
                 <li>Ensures food security of neighbouring communities by preserving wildlife and natural vegetation.</li>
                 <li>Keeps us healthy by producing clean air and water for us to consume.</li>
                 <li>Are natural buffers that mitigate the effects of: floods, storm-surges, droughts, rising sea-levels, etc., from affecting populated areas.</li>
                 <li>Behaves as excellent carbon sinks to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, i.e., they provide clean air to us.</li>
                 <li>Provides clean drinking water to the populace.</li>
                 <li>Sustains jobs, residences, and daily lives of people from around the globe, as protected areas have a far-reaching effect on society.</li>
